Homework 'Landing Page' Project utilising only HTML and CSS. Uses 12-col grid to layout the various html elements, making use of classes and ids frequently to apply styling as necessary. 
Anchor element links are not set.

Some Semantic elements were used for major sections, but because it's quite short there aren't many to take note of. 
A small media adjustment is made to reduce text size when the screen width is small enough, this allows the page to appear render fairly well until ~500px width.
There is also a text enlarging animation applied to the four words besides the main image. These are made purely using CSS animations (They're quite annoying to use) and just show off an attempt to use them for visual appeal. 

The html footer was copied from [this website listing 10 footer examples](https://web-eau.net/en/blog/10-best-footer-html-css-snippets), using the 2nd example specifically, and repurposed to better fit my page. 
I.e Removed icons for social links, placed into the 12-col grid, and amended text properties.
